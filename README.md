`/input_files` contains all the input srcipts from simulations to obtain the post-processing data.

`/plotting` contains all the plotting data and plotting scripts.

`/2D-IR-Raman` is the demos for obtaining 2D-IR-Raman spectrum outside the cavity.

`/2D-IR-Raman-in-cavity` is the demos for obtaining 2D-IR-Raman spectrum under vibrational strong coupling (VSC).
